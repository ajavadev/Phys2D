# Phys2D: A 2D Physics Simulator written in Java

This project is a custom-built 2D physics engine written in Java using the **Lightweight Java Game Library**. It was created for the **Alabama Governor's App Challenge**, showcasing advanced physics simulations and game development techniques in a lightweight and efficient manner.

## Features

### Core Physics
- **Collision Detection:** Efficient and accurate collision handling for various shapes.
- **Rigidbody Dynamics:** Supports linear and rotational movement.
- **Force Applications:** Apply forces such as gravity, friction, and custom external forces.

### Simulation
- **Time-Step Integration:** Provides smooth and consistent physics updates.
- **Configurable Environment:** Easily customize world parameters, including gravity and damping factors.

### Game Engine Integration
- **LWJGL Support:** Designed to seamlessly integrate with the LWJGL framework.
- **Entity System:** Uses a modular approach with separate classes for sprites and entities, inspired by modern game development paradigms.
- **Scalability:** Optimized for small-scale games and prototypes.

### Debugging and Testing
- **Visualization Tools:** Visual representations of physics bodies for debugging purposes.
- **Unit Testing Framework:** Includes test cases for key physics engine components.

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of the **Alabama Governor's App Challenge** to demonstrate technical proficiency and innovation in software development. It serves as an example of a specialized 2D physics engine built from the ground up.
